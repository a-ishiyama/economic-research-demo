This is a repo for my undergraduate thesis on "empirical estimation of institutional capital".

The aim of the paper is to provide an empirical justification for Hirofumi Uzawa (Japanese Economist)’s theory that Institutional Capital (well-managed education and healthcare systems) can positively affect the utility of life and well-being, with additional surplus if the two are provided together.

The paper implements OLS and Ordered Probit models on samples collected from Europe, examining the universality of economic theories for populations from different geo-location.

The results show that educational and healthcare capital affect life Satisfaction positively. 

There is also an empirical relation between the two capital that when they are provided simultaneously, individuals can enjoy additional utility. 

On average, the likelihood of achieving a higher life Satisfaction increases substantially when institutional capital is provided with improved completeness.

The .pdf file titled "thesis.pdf" is the submitted paper.

The .do file is the language used for the statistical software "STATA".

It demonstrates how I started my journey in statistical modelling, and showcase how my statistical and coding skills have evolved and advanced over the years, compared to the more sophisticated methods and contents listed on my other repos.
